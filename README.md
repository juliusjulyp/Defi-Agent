This is the beginning of the defi agent project btcdata file is used to generate data that is used to train our model
First analysis is used to train the model, we managed to transpile the model but since not everything was not supported sierra file was not generated 
but we will still improve on the same to make sure compatibility with giza
More analysis will be added since in this model we are using moving averages therefore more data is to be brought onchain including bid and asks order to 
help make analysis.
Technical indicators will also be brought for analysis and therefore after the model improves we'll be able to bring the agent to the world 
making it usable and easily accesible rendering it's information in a good UI.
All recomendation and how can improve are welcome.
